# LemmingsStudio
Recode of the game Lemmings

## Presentation of the game
The goal is to get as much lemmings (the potato heads) as you can through the gate. 
\
These characters will spawn and walk only one way. 
So you have to direct them thanks to the commands so that they don't fall or just get stuck between walls.
\
To do so: select an action and attribute it to a character.

5 actions are available to command the lemmings.

![actions](./screenshots/actions.png)

- The block makes the potato head act as a wall. Every mate that encounters him changes direction.
- This action makes the potato head nuke himself. Use with moderation.
- The dig action gives the potato head the power of a dwarf ! Good if you have a wall that bothers you.
- Climbing enables him to access higher structures !
- The parachute prevent the potato head to fall and be smooched on the ground.

We implemented 3 levels.

But first the home screen !

### Level 1

*Your goal in this level is to place the potato head at the good place so they do not fall 
(like it happen where there is a grave)*

### Level 2

![level 2](./screenshots/level2.png)
*Here your plan will be to either climb or dig this stupid wall. Then be careful, the platform is very high ! you don't want to clean up the mashed potato...*
